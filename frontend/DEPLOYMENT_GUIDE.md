## The Easiest Way: Netlify Drop

Since you have a finished build, the quickest way to get a public link is to use **Netlify Drop**.

1.  **Locate your "dist" folder**:
    *   Open your file explorer to your project folder: `c:\Users\rohan\Downloads\pickyoursocks`
    *   You should see a folder named **`dist`** (this is the "distribution" folder I just built for you).

2.  **Go to Netlify Drop**:
    *   Open your web browser and go to: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

3.  **Drag and Drop**:
    *   Simply drag that **`dist`** folder from your file explorer and drop it onto the target area on the Netlify webpage.

4.  **Done!**
    *   Netlify will instantly upload it and give you a live URL (like `https://jovial-babbage-123456.netlify.app`).
    *   Copy that link and send it to your friends!

4.  It will give you a `vercel.app` link.
